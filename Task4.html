 <p class="p1">Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.
JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.
    History: Java’s history is very interesting. It is a programming language created in 1991. James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the Green team initiated the Java language in 1991. Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in 1996 as Java 1.0. It provides no-cost -run-times on popular platforms. Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to strictly comply with its specifications. With the arrival of Java 2, new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.
    In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
    On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine as free, open-source software. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM’s core code available under open-source distribution terms.
    The principles for creating java were simple, robust, secured, high-performance, portable, multi-threaded, interpreted, dynamic, etc. In 1995 Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the Father of Java. Currently, Java is used in mobile devices, internet programming, games, e-business, etc.
    Implementation of a Java application program involves a following step. They include 1. Creating the progra 2. Compiling the progra 3. Running the program
    Remember that, before we begin creating the program, the Java Development Kit (JDK) must be properly installed on our system and also path will be set.
    • Creating Program We can create a program using Text Editor (Notepad) or IDE (NetBeans)   class Test public static void main(String []aSystem.out.println(“My First Java Program.”)};
    File -> Save -> d:\Test.java• Compiling the program To compile the program, we must run the Java compiler (javac), with the name of the source file on “command prompt” like as follows
   If everything is OK, the “javac” compiler creates a file called “Test.class” containing byte code of the program.• Running the program We need to use the Java Interpreter to run a program.
  Java programming language is named JAVA. Why?After the name OAK, the team decided to give it a new name to it and the suggested words were Silk, Jolt, revolutionary, DNA, dynamic, etc. These all names were easy to spell and fun to say, but they all wanted the name to reflect the essence of technology. In accordance with James Gosling, Java the among the top names along with Silk, and since java was a unique name so most of them preferred it.
  Java is the name of an island in Indonesia where the first coffee(named java coffee) was produced. And this name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee near his office. Note that Java is just a name, not an acronym.
  Java TerminologyOur core Java programming tutorial is designed for students and working professionals. Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language. It is a widely used robust technology.
What is Java?Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
 Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.
Java ExampleLet's have a quick look at Java programming example. A detailed description of Hello Java example is available in next page.Simple.java class Simple{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  System.out.println("Hello Java"); Test it NApplicationAccording to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:
  Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
    MobileEmbedded SystemSmart CardRoboticsGames, etc.Types of Java ApplicationsThere are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:
     1) Standalone ApplicationStandalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.
    2) Web ApplicationAn application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.
     3) Enterprise Application An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called an enterprise application. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.
    4) Mobile ApplicationAn application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.
    Java Platforms / EditionsThere are 4 platforms or editions of Java:1) Java SE (Java Standard Edition)
    It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc. It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.
    2) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)It is an enterprise platform that is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.
   3) Java ME (Java Micro Edition)It is a micro platform that is dedicated to mobile applications4) JavaFXIt is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a lightweight user interface API.

Our C tutorial explains each topic with programs.
    The C Language is developed by Dennis Ritchie for creating system applications that directly interact with the hardware devices such as drivers, kernels, etc.
    C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known as mother language.It can be defined by the following ways:Mother language
    System programming languageProcedure-oriented programming languageStructured programming languageMid-level programming language1) C as a mother language
    C language is considered as the mother language of all the modern programming languages because most of the compilers, JVMs, Kernels, etc. are written in C language, and most of the programming languages follow C syntax, for example, C++, Java, C#, etc.
    It provides the core concepts like the array, strings, functions, file handling, etc. that are being used in many languages like C++, Java, C#, etc.2) C as a system programming language
    A system programming language is used to create system software. C language is a system programming language because it can be used to do low-level programming (for example driver and kernel). It is generally used to create hardware devices, OS, drivers, kernels, etc. For example, Linux kernel is written in C.
   It can't be used for internet programming like Java, .Net, PHP, etc.3) C as a procedural language A procedure is known as a function, method, routine, subroutine, etc. A procedural language specifies a series of steps for the program to solve the problem.
    A procedural language breaks the program into functions, data structures, etc.C is a procedural language. In C, variables and function prototypes must be declared before being used.
    4) C as a structured programming languageA structured programming language is a subset of the procedural language. Structure means to break a program into parts or blocks so that it may be easy to understand.
    In the C language, we break the program into parts using functions. It makes the program easier to understand and modify. 5) C as a mid-level programming language
    C is considered as a middle-level language because it supports the feature of both low-level and high-level languages. C language program is converted into assembly code, it supports pointer arithmetic (low-level), but it is machine independent (a feature of high-level).
    A Low-level language is specific to one machine, i.e., machine dependent. It is machine dependent, fast to run. But it is not easy to understand.A High-Level language is not specific to one machine, i.e., machine independent. It is easy to understand.
    C ProgramIn this tutorial, all C programs are given with C compiler so that you can quickly change the C program code.File: main.c#include <stdio.h>  int main() {

    Encapsulation in JavaEncapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
     encapsulation in java We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.
    The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.Advantage of Encapsulation in JavaBy providing only a setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only. In other words, you can skip the getter or setter methods.
     It provides you the control over the data. Suppose you want to set the value of id which should be greater than 100 only, you can write the logic inside the setter method. You can write the logic not to store the negative numbers in the setter methods.
    It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.
    The encapsulate class is easy to test. So, it is better for unit testing.The standard IDE's are providing the facility to generate the getters and setters. So, it is easy and fast to create an encapsulated class in Java.
    Simple Example of Encapsulation in JavaLet's see the simple example of encapsulation that has only one field with its setter and getter methods.
     File: Student.java //A Java class which is a fully encapsulated class.   //It has a private data member and getter and setter methods.   package com.javatpoint;  
    public class Student{  //private data member  private String name;  //getter method for name  public String getName(){  return name;  }  //setter method for name  
    public void setName(String name){  this.name=name  }  }  File: Test.java//A Java class to test the encapsulated class.  package com.javatpoint;  class Test{  
    public static void main(String[] args){   //creating instance of the encapsulated class   Student s=new Student();   //setting value in the name member  
    s.setName("vijay");   //getting value of the name member   System.out.println(s.getName());   }   }   Compile By: javac -d . Test.java Run By: java com.javatpoint.Test
    Output:vijayRead-Only class//A Java class which has only getter methods.  public class Student{  JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation.
